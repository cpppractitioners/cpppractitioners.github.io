#### Google Group [cpppractitioners](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cpppractitioners) Formed

We have formed a google group to act as an announcement mailing list.  There is also an email address (cpppractitioners@gmail.com) where you can send questions, comments, etc.

### About

We are pleased to announce the formation of the C++ Practitioners Forum (https://cpppractitioners.github.io).  This Chicago based group is designed to encourage discussion of C++ related topics among industry participants.  Our aim is to meet quarterly and engage in relevant discussions about C++ topics.

Participants will be able to give short presentations on “tricks of the trade”, current coding issues, interesting third party libraries, and other relevant topics.  Subsequently, the group will spend time discussing the presentations, offering ideas and comments and engaging in discourse regarding the presentations.

Our goal is to provide a forum for C++ developers to share insights and receive feedback on design, code, and other C++ and coding related issues.  Too often we operate in the vacuum of our own companies and fail to substantially grow our knowledge bases and coding practices.  This forum aims to rectify this as well as create professional and social ties among members.

If you (or any of your friends or colleagues) are interested in joining us, please join our [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cpppractitioners).  The goal will be to have 4 to 6 presentations for each two hour meeting.  Food and beverages will be provided.

If you have any questions, please email cpppractitioners@gmail.com.

We hope this will be a fun and fruitful experience for all those involved.

C++ Practitioners Forum is sponsored by Ketchum Trading, LLC.  We are actively looking for other sponsors.
